# 1. Mobile Framework Selection

Date: 2025-03-06 (Updated)

## Status

Revised and Accepted

## Context

We need to develop mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms for our cargo shipping system. Our primary concerns include development efficiency, performance, maintainability, and offline capabilities. The applications (Booking App and Sales Management App) need to provide a high-quality user experience with local-first functionality allowing users to work primarily offline with periodic synchronization to the backend.

## Decision

We will use native development approaches for both platforms:
- Android: Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for UI
- iOS: Swift with SwiftUI for UI

This approach replaces the previous consideration of using React Native.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Optimal performance on each platform by using platform-specific technologies
- Full access to native APIs and capabilities without bridges or wrappers
- Better support for complex offline-first functionality and local storage
- Direct integration with platform-specific security features
- Native look and feel for each platform, improving user experience
- Ability to leverage platform-specific optimizations
- Modern declarative UI frameworks (Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI) provide similar development paradigms across platforms

### Negative

- Requires maintaining two separate codebases
- Higher development costs due to platform-specific development teams or expertise
- Potentially longer development cycles for feature parity across platforms
- Limited code sharing between platforms (primarily architecture patterns and business logic design)
- Need for platform-specific testing pipelines

## Implementation Approach

- Establish a common architecture pattern across both platforms (following Clean Architecture principles)
- Create shared domain models and business rules documentation to maintain consistency
- Implement robust offline-first capabilities with conflict resolution strategies
- Design a synchronization protocol that efficiently handles intermittent connectivity
- Follow DDD (Domain-Driven Design) principles for both applications to maintain conceptual integrity
- Develop common test cases that can be implemented on both platforms
